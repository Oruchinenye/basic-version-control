# basic-version-control
Explain version control- Version control also known as source control or revision control, is a system for managing changes to computer programs, documents, and other information collections. It records the history of changes to a file or set of files over time allowing users to recall specific versions later. Version control systems help software teams track and manage changes to source code, enabling them to work faster, smarter, and more collaboratively. Version control software also helps in resolving merge conflicts, tracking revisions, and managing different versions of application artifacts. popular version control systems include Git, subversion and Mercurial, each offering its own set of features and capabilities.


Explain difference between git and github- Git is a distributed version control system focused on tracking changes in source code. It is a command-line tool installed locally on a system, designed for coordinating work among programmers and managing source code history. While Github is a web-based Git repository hosting service, which offers all the distributed revision control and source code management functionality. It is a centralized source code hosting platform, providing a graphical user interface, user management features, and a marketplace for tool integration. Git is also a software maintained by Linux and is open-source licensed, while Github is a service maintained by microsoft and follows a specific pricing model. In simple terms, Git is a version control system, and Github is a hosting service for Git repositories.


List 3 other github alternatives- a.) Gitlab: Gitlab is a web-based DevSecOps platform that offers a complete solution for the entire software development lifecycle, including project planning, monitoring, security, and CI/CD integration. It is open-source and offers a range of features and tools to support the entire software development process. b.) Bitbucket: Bitbucket is a code hosting platform that offers free private repositories, solid collaboration, and seamless integration with Jira and other Atlassian tools. It is a good choice for teams looking for a code hosting platform with advanced collaboration and management tools. c.) Gitea: Gitea is a self-hosted, all-in-one software development service that includes Git hosting, code review, team collaboration, package registry, and CI/CD. It is similar to Github and offers a range of features and tools to support the entire software development process.


Explain the difference between git fetch and git pull- Git fetch retrieves the latest changes from the remote repository to the local repository, allowing the user to review the changes before merging. It does not affect the working copy. In the other hand, Git pull retrives the changes from the remote repository and automatically merges them into the current branch. It affects both the local repository and the working copy. In summary. git fetch is used to retrive changes for review, while git pull is used to retrive and merge changes immediately.


Explain in simple terms git rebase and the command for it- Git rebase is a command that allows you to move a sequence of commits from one branch to another. It is a way to integrate changes from one branch onto another by changing the base branch. The rebase command rewrites the commit history, making it look like the branch was created from a diiferent commit. This can be useful for keeping the commit history clean and organized. The command for git rebase is 'git rebase <base>', where '<base>' is the commit you want to rebase onto. You can also use the'-i' flag to launch an interactive rebase session which allows you to move a sequence of commits from one branch to another, and it can be used to keep the commit history clean and organized.


Explain in simple terms git cherry-pick and the command for it- Git cherry-pick is a command that allows you to selectively apply specific commits from one branch to another. It is useful for fixing mistakes, sharing code, or applying changes from one branch to another without merging the entire branch. The command for git cherry-pick is 'git cherry-pick <commit>', where '<commit>' is the commit reference you want to apply. Some simple explanation of how to use git cherry-pick: 1.) Ensure you are on the branch you want to apply the commit to. 2.) Run the 'git cherry-pick <commit>' command, replacing '<commit>' with the commit reference you want to apply. For example, if you want to apply commit 'f' from the 'main' branch to the 'feature' branch, follow these steps: a.) Checkout the 'feature' branch: 'git checkout feature'. b.) Run the 'git cherry-pick f' command. After executing the cherry-pick command, the commit will be applied to the 'feature' branch, and the Git history will look like this: a - b - c - d - f (Main), e -f - g (feature). In conclusion, git cherry-pick is a command that allows you to selectively apply specific commits from one branch to another, and it can be used to fix mistakes, share code, or apply changes without merging the entire branch.
